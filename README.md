## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **Market data not loading**: Try refreshing the page or check API rate limits
3. **Orders not executing**: Ensure sufficient balance for buy orders or sufficient position for sell orders
4. **Fear & Greed Index showing 0**: This is a fallback value; the system will retry fetching real data
5. **News not loading**: Check internet connection and RSS feed availability

### Performance Tips
- The app auto-refreshes for real-time updates
- Large portfolios may take longer to load
- Close unused browser tabs to improve performance
